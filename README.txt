Well this is the story all about how my life got flip turned upside down 
and I'd like to take a minute just sit right there 
and I'll tell all about how I became the prince of bel air.

IN  WEST PHILIDELPHIA BORN AND RAISED
ON A PLAYGROUND WHERE I SPENT MOST OF MY DAYS
CHILLING OUT RELAXING, ACTING ALL COOL
WHEN A COUPLE OF GUYS, UP TO NO GOOD
STARTED MAKING TROUBLE IN MY NEIGHBOURHOOD
